# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project Touchstones

This document serves as a learning repository of important Project insights.

## Purpose

Touchstones.md serves to:
- Record and rationalize important issues arising at a granular level during development.
- Give coherence to reviews of other documents, by pointing the review to Touchstones.md
- Be available for public inspection.

## Touchstone Quality Standards

Touchstones must be
- Important - Fundamental to Project understanding
- Encapsulated - Expressed concisely and precisely
- Reasonably distinct - Not duplicating existing touchstones

## Core Touchstones

### Terminology

- The Project refers to the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project or UFSCMCP.
- In the context of the Project, Users (ie capitalised) refers to financial institutions or enterprises, and their staff or suitably authorised personnel.
- Compliance refers to acting in accordance with Standards
- Standards refers to regulatory frameworks, industry codes, statutory requirements, international standards, jurisdictional regulations and any analogous sets of criteria which financial institutions have to meet and includes consultation documents.
- Implemented Standard refers to a Standard which is specifically covered by the Project's suite of MCP servers.
- Universal in the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project name refers to an architecture designed to accommodate any Standard, not that the Project currently covers all Standards. It only covers Implemented Standards.

### Value Proposition  
- Using the MCP will make it easier to bring the right product safely to consumers
- Using the MCP will enable compliance professionals to carry out senior executive tasks rather than get entangled in small-print
- Compliance with Implemented Standards is impossible without AI tools.
- Human effectiveness is transformationally enhanced
- Humans still have final responsibility, the MCP's role is to make that responsibility manageable
  
### Use of MCP Protocol
- The MCP server runs its own LLM completely independently from enterprise AI agent LLM choices, eliminating adoption barriers
- The external LLM using the MCP is a matter of User choice and has no bearing on MCP server operation
- This architectural separation allows enterprises to use any AI agent while accessing specialized compliance intelligence
- The User can however specify the LLM to be used by the MCP
- The MCP is open-source and transparent for trust and auditability
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration makes the platform AI-agent native

### Project Management
- Documentation maintains professional tone suited to corporate financial services audience
- These Touchstones are systematically applied in reviewing all components to ensure strategic alignment
- To achieve permanent integrity of the MCP, a review process covers content quality, alignment, multi-perspective validity, and effective implementation into programming code
- The standard format for Project documentation is the AI-friendly markdown format.
- A formal process is regularly applied to ensure that Implemented Standards are updated as needed.

### Development Methodology
- Context Engineering (including RAG and Prompt Engineering) is adopted for ultra-rapid ultra-strong product development
- The Context Engineering is achieved through the Project's .md documents, which achieve public inspectability and over-arching system integrity.
