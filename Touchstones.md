# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project Touchstones

This document serves as a learning repository of important Project insights.

## Purpose

Touchstones.md serves to:
- Record and rationalize important issues arising at a granular level during development.
- Give coherence to .md reviews as outlined in MDqualityCheck.md
- Be available for public inspection.

## Touchstone Quality Standards

Touchstones must be
- **Important** - Fundamental to Project understanding
- **Encapsulated** - Expressed concisely and precisely
- **Reasonably distinct** - Not duplicating existing touchstones

## Core Touchstones

### Terminology

- The Project refers to the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project, whose purpose is to create a suite of specialist Compliance MCP servers. For example when the MCP server applies to the FCA, it will be called mcp-server-fca-compliance
- In the context of the Project, Users (ie capitalised) refers to financial institutions or enterprises, "users" (ie non capitalised) refers to individuals.
- Compliance refers to acting in accordance with Standards
- Standards refers to regulatory frameworks, industry codes, statutory requirements, international standards, jurisdictional regulations and any analogous sets of criteria which financial institutions have to meet and includes consultation documents.
- Implemented Standard refers to a Standard which is specifically covered by the Project's suite of MCP servers.
- Universal in the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project name refers to an architecture designed to accommodate any Standard, not that the Project currently covers all Standards. It only covers Implemented Standards.

### Strategic Positioning
- The objective for the MCP is to be a Universal Compliance intelligent MCP in financial services
- The FCA Handbook is the first Implemented Standard: a proof of concept
- Other standards will be processed using the architectures established through the FCA Handbook exercise

### Value Proposition  
- Using the MCP will make it easier to bring the right product safely to consumers
- Using the MCP will enable compliance professionals to carry out senior executive tasks rather than get entangled in small-print
- Compliance with Implemented Standards is impossible without AI tools.
- Human effectiveness is transformationally enhanced
- Humans still have final responsibility, the MCP's role is to make that responsibility manageable
- The MCP transforms consultation document analysis from reactive scrambling to proactive strategic planning
  
### Use of MCP Protocol
- The MCP server runs its own LLM completely independently from enterprise AI agent LLM choices, eliminating adoption barriers
- The external LLM calling the MCP is a matter of user choice and has no bearing on MCP server operation
- This architectural separation allows enterprises to use any AI agent while accessing specialized compliance intelligence
- The MCP is open-source and transparent for trust and auditability
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration makes the platform AI-agent native
- Enterprise-grade data protection addresses financial services privacy requirements.

### Project Management
- Documentation maintains professional tone suited to corporate financial services audience
- These Touchstones are systematically applied in reviewing all components to ensure strategic alignment
- To achieve permanent integrity of the MCP, a review process covers content quality, alignment, multi-perspective validity, and effective implementation into programming code
- The standard format for Project documentation is the AI-friendly markdown format.
- A formal process is regularly applied to ensure that Implemented Standards are updated as needed.

### Development Methodology
- Context Engineering (including RAG and Prompt Engineering) is adopted for ultra-rapid ultra-strong product development
- The Context Engineering is achieved through the Project's .md documents, which achieve public inspectability and over-arching system integrity.
- Human-AI collaboration concertinas development timelines - achieves in days what otherwise takes months
