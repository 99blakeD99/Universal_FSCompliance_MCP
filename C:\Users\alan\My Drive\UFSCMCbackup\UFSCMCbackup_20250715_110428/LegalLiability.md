# Legal Liability Framework

## Purpose and Scope

This document sets out the legal liability framework for the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product, defining user responsibilities and product limitations to ensure appropriate allocation of legal and Compliance risk.

## Core Liability Principles

### 1. User Responsibility Framework

**Final Responsibility**: Users retain full legal and regulatory responsibility for all Compliance decisions, actions, and outcomes. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product serves as an analytical tool to assist decision-making but does not replace professional judgment or legal accountability.

**Professional Oversight**: Users must ensure that all Compliance activities are supervised by appropriately qualified Compliance professionals with relevant regulatory knowledge and authority.

**Validation Requirement**: Users are responsible for validating all tool outputs against their specific regulatory context, business circumstances, and current regulatory requirements.

### 2. Product Liability Limitations

**Information Tool Only**: The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product provides information and analysis but does not constitute legal advice, regulatory guidance, or Compliance recommendations.

**No Warranty of Accuracy**: While the Product aims for accuracy, no warranty is provided regarding the completeness, currency, or applicability of any information or analysis provided.

**Regulatory Change Risk**: Users acknowledge that regulatory requirements change frequently and accept responsibility for ensuring current Compliance with applicable Standards.

## Specific Risk Areas

### Standard Ingestion Liability

When using the `ingest_new_identified_standard` tool, users accept responsibility for:
- Ensuring they have legal authority to ingest the specified Standard
- Verifying the accuracy and completeness of source materials
- Confirming regulatory applicability to their specific circumstances
- Managing any intellectual property or licensing considerations

*This will be reviewed more systematically as the User base grows.*

### AI-Generated Content Disclaimer

All tool outputs are generated by AI systems and require human review and validation. Users acknowledge that AI-generated content may contain errors, omissions, or inappropriate recommendations and accept responsibility for professional oversight.

### Data and Privacy Responsibilities

Users are responsible for:
- Ensuring Compliance with data protection regulations when using the Product
- Managing confidentiality of proprietary information shared with the system
- Obtaining necessary permissions for data processing activities

## Operational Reinforcement

### User Interface Integration

Key liability reminders will be integrated into the user interface through:
- Initial acceptance of liability terms before system access
- Periodic reinforcement notifications during extended sessions
- Tool-specific warnings for high-risk activities (e.g., Standard ingestion)

*Implementation details will be developed in coordination with UserInterface.md specifications.*

### Documentation Requirements

Users are encouraged to ensure that their IT is set up in such a way as to maintain permanent records of:
- Tool usage and outputs for Compliance audit purposes
- Professional review and validation of AI-generated recommendations
- Decision-making processes and rationale for Compliance actions

## Legal Framework Evolution

### Current Status

This framework establishes baseline liability principles based on industry best practices for AI-powered Compliance tools and financial services software. 

### Planned Development

- Systematic review of comparable MCP server legal frameworks
- Analysis of RegTech industry standard liability limitations
- Legal counsel review of framework completeness and enforceability
- Integration with formal terms of service and user agreements

*This framework will be reviewed more systematically as the User base grows and regulatory clarity around AI liability develops.*

## Compliance with Regulatory Expectations

### FCA Regulatory Approach

Users operating under FCA jurisdiction acknowledge that:
- Senior Management Function (SMF) responsibilities cannot be delegated to AI systems
- Compliance oversight remains a core management responsibility
- AI tools must be subject to appropriate governance and control frameworks

### International Considerations

Users in other jurisdictions acknowledge responsibility for ensuring Compliance with local regulatory requirements regarding AI tool usage in Compliance functions.

## Emergency Procedures

### System Limitations

In the event of system errors, outages, or suspected inaccuracies:
- Users must not rely solely on the Product for time-sensitive Compliance decisions
- Alternative Compliance verification methods must be available
- Professional Compliance resources should be engaged immediately

### Incident Reporting

Users are encouraged to report system issues or potential liability concerns through established support channels to enable continuous improvement and risk management.
