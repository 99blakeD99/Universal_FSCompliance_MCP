# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project Touchstones

This document serves as a learning repository of important Project and Product insights.

## Purpose

Touchstones.md serves to:
- Record and rationalize important issues arising at a granular level during development.
- Give coherence to .md reviews as outlined in MDqualityCheck.md
- Be available for public inspection.

## Touchstone Quality Standards

Touchstones must be
- **Important** - Fundamental to Project and Product understanding
- **Encapsulated** - Expressed concisely and precisely
- **Reasonably distinct** - Not duplicating existing touchstones

## Core Touchstones

### Terminology

- The Product, or the MCP, refers to the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product.
- The Project refers to the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project.
- In the context of the Product, Users (ie capitalised) refers to financial institutions or enterprises, "users" (ie non capitalised) refers to individuals.
- Compliance refers to acting in accordance with Standards
- Standards refers to regulatory frameworks, industry codes, statutory requirements, international standards, jurisdictional regulations and any analogous sets of criteria which financial institutions have to meet and includes consultation documents.
- Identified Standard refers to a Standard which is specifically covered by the Product.
- Universal in the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product name refers to an architecture designed to accommodate any Standard, not that the Product currently covers all Standards. It only covers implemented Identified Standards.

### Strategic Positioning
- The objective for the MCP is to be a Universal Compliance intelligent MCP in financial services
- The FCA Handbook is the first Identified Standard: a proof of concept
- Other standards will be processed using the architectures established through the FCA Handbook exercise

### Value Proposition  
- Using the MCP will achieve slicing through red tape
- Using the MCP will make it easier to bring the right product safely to consumers
- Using the MCP will help deal with the knotweed nature of rules and regulations.
- Using the MCP will enable compliance professionals to carry out senior executive tasks rather than get entangled in small-print
- Compliance with Identified Standards is impossible without AI tools.
- Human effectiveness is transformationally enhanced
- Humans still have final responsibility, the MCP's role is to make that responsibility manageable
- The MCP transforms consultation document analysis from reactive scrambling to proactive strategic planning
  
### Use of MCP Protocol
- The MCP internally allows use of any LLM within the MCP
- The external LLM calling the MCP is a matter of user choice and has no bearing on use of the MCP
- The MCP is open-source and transparent for trust and auditability
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration makes the platform AI-agent native
- Enterprise-grade data protection addresses financial services privacy requirements.

### Project Management
- Documentation maintains professional tone suited to corporate financial services audience
- These Touchstones are systematically applied in reviewing all components to ensure strategic alignment
- To achieve permanent integrity of the MCP, a review process covers content quality, alignment, multi-perspective validity, and effective implementation into programming code
- The standard format for Project documentation is the AI-friendly markdown format.
- A formal process is regularly applied to ensure that Identified Standards once implemented are updated as needed..

### Development Methodology
- Prompt engineering for ultra-rapid ultra-strong product development
- Human-AI collaboration concertinas development timelines - achieves in days what otherwise takes months
