- Enterprise security implementation requires LLM integration completion
- Production deployment depends on comprehensive testing and security audit completion

## Schedule Management

### Critical Path
1. **MCP Server Framework** → **Data Infrastructure** → **Compliance Analysis Engine** → **LLM Integration** → **Enterprise Security** → **Production Deployment**

### Key Milestones
For detailed milestone tracking and completion status, see Tasks.md phase completion criteria.

### Dependencies
- **External**: MCP protocol specification stability, Claude 3.5 Sonnet API availability
- **Internal**: FCA Handbook data processing completion before compliance analysis development
- **Resource**: Technical expertise availability for security implementation

## Resource Management

### Human Resources
**AI-Assisted Development Model:**
- **Technical Lead**: Full-stack development with Claude Code collaboration (1 FTE)
- **Security Specialist**: Enterprise security implementation (0.3 FTE)
- **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure (0.3 FTE)
- **Documentation**: AI-assisted technical writing and user guides (0.2 FTE)

**Total Resource Requirements**: 1.8 FTE equivalent over 30 weeks (reduced through AI collaboration)

### Technology Resources
**Development Environment:**
- GitHub repository with Actions CI/CD
- Cloud development environment (Azure/AWS)
- Testing infrastructure for load and security testing

**Production Infrastructure:**
- Cloud hosting for demonstration and testing
- Docker containerization for deployment
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Budget Considerations
**Bootstrap Development Model:**
- **Personnel**: Reduced costs through AI-assisted development
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal cloud hosting and development tools
- **Security**: Essential security audits and penetration testing
- **Legal**: Open-source licensing review (MIT License)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**High-Impact Risks:**
1. **LLM Accuracy Issues** - For detailed risk analysis and mitigation strategies, see LLMChoice.md
2. **Performance Bottlenecks** (Probability: High, Impact: Medium)
   - *Mitigation*: Performance testing, caching strategies, database optimization
   - *Contingency*: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, query optimization
3. **Security Vulnerabilities** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
   - *Mitigation*: Security audits, penetration testing, security-first development
   - *Contingency*: Rapid patching process, security incident response plan

**Medium-Impact Risks:**
4. **MCP Protocol Changes** (Probability: Low, Impact: Medium)
   - *Mitigation*: Active monitoring of protocol updates, modular architecture
5. **Third-Party Dependencies** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - *Mitigation*: Dependency monitoring, version pinning, alternative evaluation

### Business Risks

6. **Market Timing** (Probability: Low, Impact: High)
   - *Mitigation*: Rapid development cycles, early market validation
   - *Contingency*: Pivot strategy, feature prioritization adjustment

7. **Regulatory Changes** (Probability: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - *Mitigation*: Regulatory monitoring, flexible architecture design
   - *Contingency*: Rapid compliance updates, legal consultation

8. **Insufficient Enterprise Interest** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
   - *Mitigation*: AI-optimized enterprise engagement strategy per BusinessDevelopment.md
   - *Contingency*: Enhanced inreach through README.md optimization for AI appraisal agents, expanded outreach to additional enterprises

## Quality Management

### Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, <2 second response time, 99.9% uptime target
- **Security**: OWASP compliance, regular security audits, penetration testing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API docs, user guides, deployment instructions

For detailed technical implementation and testing strategy, see TechnicalArchitecture.md.

## Communication Plan
