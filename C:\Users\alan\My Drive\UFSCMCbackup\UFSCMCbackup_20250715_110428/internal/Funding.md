# Funding.md

This document addresses the funding needs of the FSCompliance project.

## Current State

Phase 2 has been completed. This has allowed us to scope the landscape and build sound foundations. It is clear that the potential is much higher than originally envisaged.

The BD-CC team (Blake Dempster working with Claude Code) have demonstrated that they constitute a very effective and efficient team for taking it on.

So far it has taken BD-CC 8 days to build comprehensive strategic documentation, technical architecture, and professional presentation materials for a complete, ambitious MCP platform, at an estimated token cost of £125. This is astonishing productivity. There is no reason to expect that to change. We expect future development to be similarly concertina-ed.

The BD-CC team is believed to be sufficient for future needs even when the MCP is very much bigger.

## Costs

### API Costs Per Month 

API costs are a significant proportion of total costs in the AI era. The following are budgeted.

**Development Phase:** £1,200-1,400/month
- Claude LLM: £500/month
- Azure (compute, storage, networking): £500-700/month
- Supabase: £400-800/month (enterprise tier for consistency)
- Other APIs: £100-200/month

**Production Deployment:** £1,500-2,000/month
- Claude LLM: £500/month
- Azure (production workloads, redundancy): £800-1,200/month
- Supabase: £400-800/month
- Other APIs: £100-200/month

**Enterprise Scale:** £2,000-3,000/month
- Claude LLM: £500/month
- Azure (enterprise infrastructure, security, compliance): £1,200-2,000/month
- Supabase: £400-800/month
- Other APIs: £100-200/month

Using Enterprise Scale APIs from Day 1 will eliminate future migration complexity and establish enterprise-grade infrastructure, and create credibility with our corporate target market.

### Staff Costs

Essentially there is no need for any other staff other than BD (working with CC).

BD is the sole owner of JBMD, the owner of the MCP.

BD running costs, including home, office, laptop, debt servicing, accounting etc amount to £15000pm

Funding these immediate needs will allow BD to switch full time to this project.

### Capital Costs

Zero.

### Other Running Costs

Initially, zero. All done automatically. We may need to get accounting, legal and other advice in due course depending on the direction we take, but even here CC will do most of the heavy lifting.

### Marketing Costs

#### Sales Targets

The sales targets are (CC please get these from success metrics. For now, leave this as tbc.)

#### Marketing Activity

To achieve these targets will require sustained and significant marketing. Marketing plans will need to be developed in due course, dependent on funders as outlined below.

## Revenue

CC please propose a pricing model and produce revenue numbers that go with our targets. For now, leave this as tbc.

## Funding Gap

CC please do a month by month projection of revenue v costs for 36 months. For now, leave this as tbc.

## Development Timelines

The formal development timelines are set out in [Tasks.md](../Tasks.md). However, based on work to date (which achieved in 8 days what was originally projected to take months), we expect to cut the development timelines by at least 75%.


## Ideal Funder

### Marketing

Potential funders will normally be well connected amongst the Financial Institutions and financial services companies who constitute the MCP's target market. This makes it likely that our optimum marketing strategy will be largely a bolt-on to theirs. This will drive down marketing costs. Indeed marketing the MCP on a standalone from a standing start will probably result in failure. This consideration is important in finding a suitable funder.

### Six Month "Sponsorship"

There is limited need for short term funding. The best approach is to apply to potential funders for six months' "sponsorship", then review possibilities after that. This fits the very early stages of the project, we want to keep options open as much as we can until the project has taken fuller shape – so we want to avoid over-structured funding arrangements for now.

### Ideally, Anthropic

Based on goodness of fit as outlined above.
