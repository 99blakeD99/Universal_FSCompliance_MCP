## Charging Models Architecture

Rather than selecting a single pricing approach, the MCP Server implements a flexible, configuration-driven architecture supporting multiple concurrent billing models optimized for different customer segments and use cases.

### Core Charging Models

**Note**: All pricing examples below are indicative of potential future levels. During market validation phases, all charges are set to zero as stated in the Primary Architecture Decision above.

**Per-Query Pricing (Indicative):**
```yaml
# Usage-based pricing aligned with compliance value (future indicative rates)
simple_compliance_check: £0.05     # Currently £0.00

## Technical Architecture Requirements

### Billing Infrastructure Schema

The billing architecture integrates seamlessly with the interaction analytics framework defined in `DatabaseStrategy.md`:

```sql
-- Usage metering table (extends analytics schema)
CREATE TABLE fca_usage_billing (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    organization_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    tool_used VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    billing_event_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'query', 'report', 'validation'
    pricing_tier VARCHAR(20),       -- 'free', 'professional', 'enterprise'
    base_cost DECIMAL(10,4),        -- Cost before discounts
    applied_discounts JSONB,        -- Volume, loyalty, custom discounts
    final_cost DECIMAL(10,4),       -- Actual billable amount
    billing_period VARCHAR(7),      -- 'YYYY-MM' for aggregation
    processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    
    -- Reference to interaction analytics
    analytics_event_id UUID REFERENCES fca_tool_usage(id)
);

-- Subscription management
CREATE TABLE billing_subscriptions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organization_id VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    plan_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,     -- 'starter', 'professional', 'enterprise'
    billing_cycle VARCHAR(10),          -- 'monthly', 'annual'
    monthly_allowance INTEGER,          -- Included queries per month
    current_usage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,    -- Current month usage
    subscription_fee DECIMAL(10,2),     -- Base subscription cost
    overage_rate DECIMAL(6,4),          -- Per-query overage pricing
    billing_start DATE NOT NULL,
    billing_end DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Rate limiting and quota management
CREATE TABLE usage_quotas (
    organization_id VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    current_month VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,  -- 'YYYY-MM'
    queries_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    queries_limit INTEGER,              -- NULL = unlimited
    rate_limit_per_hour INTEGER,        -- API rate limiting
    last_reset TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Configuration-Driven Pricing

All pricing parameters must be externally configurable without code deployment:

```python
# pricing_config.yaml
pricing_models:
  launch_phase:
    all_tools: 0.00           # Zero charges for market validation
    rate_limits: unlimited    # No usage restrictions
    
  professional_phase:        # Future indicative rates (currently 0.00)
    simple_queries: 0.05      # £0.05 per basic compliance check (indicative)
    complex_analysis: 0.15    # £0.15 per systematic analysis (indicative)
    audit_reports: 0.25       # £0.25 per comprehensive report (indicative)
    
  enterprise_phase:          # Future indicative rates (currently 0.00)
    subscription_base: 500.00  # £500/month base subscription (indicative)
    included_allowance: 1000   # 1000 queries included
    overage_rate: 0.04         # £0.04 per additional query (indicative)

# Implementation pattern
class BillingService:
    def calculate_charge(self, tool_used: str, user_tier: str) -> Decimal:
        config = self.load_pricing_config()
        return config[self.current_phase][tool_used] or Decimal('0.00')
```
