# Quality Check Rules for MCP Project Documentation

This document establishes a systematic methodology for quality checking .md files to ensure consistency, formatting standards, and strategic alignment across the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project documentation.

## Review Sequence

When reviewing any .md file, follow this systematic approach:

### 1. Content Quality Check
- Avoid repetition - Don't repeat what has substantially been said before
- Professional tone - Avoid colloquialisms, avoid being bombastic, be succinct, adopt a tone suited to the corporate world, stay constructive and positive, don't be scary, don't be hyperbolic
- No links - Avoid links, either to our .mds or web links, except in README.md
- Check README.md links - ensure that all the links in README.md work.
- Internal consistency - Check the document's internal logic and consistency
- Special for OurStory.md - If reviewing OurStory.md, allow warmer narrative tone that may differ from standard corporate style. Also pay special attention to whether any "Voice" part substantively repeats a previous "Voice" part, this document is being drafted on the fly and repetition is difficult for the author to monitor.
- Special for reviewing Touchstones.md - To avoid circular reasoning, omit the Touchstones alignment requirements when reviewing Touchstones.md.
- Code block restrictions - Documentation should not contain code blocks 

### 2. Touchstones Alignment
- Check against Touchstones.md - verify no inconsistencies with Touchstones.md
- Resolve inconsistencies - If conflicts exist, resolve them or seek direction
- Identify new touchstones - If you identify potential new touchstones, raise them and seek direction on whether to add them
- Explicit touchstone assessment - Always conclude this step with either:
  - "No new touchstones proposed" (if document aligns with existing touchstones)
  - "New touchstone proposed: [description]" (if new fundamental principle identified)

### 3. Inter-Document Consistency
- Use Touchstones method - Don't try to check against every other .md file individually
- Avoid complexity overload - The Touchstones approach prevents overwhelming complexity from holding multiple documents in attention simultaneously

### 5. Multi-Perspective Review
Read the .md being reviewed in complete sweeps beginning-to-end sweeps from each relevant stakeholder viewpoint:

Financial Institution Perspectives:
1. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) - Strategic vision and business impact
2. Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) - Regulatory requirements and compliance strategy
3. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) - Strategic technology architecture and innovation
4. Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) - Data security, privacy, and risk management
5. Chief Risk Officer (CRO) - Enterprise risk management and regulatory risk

Note: Some documents may not be relevant to all perspectives - simply note this and move on to applicable viewpoints.
