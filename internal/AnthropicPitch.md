## Potential Funding from Anthropic

For Anthropic as potential funders (assuming we can find a way to ask them) the existing pitch points stand, plus a powerful further set: 

- The MCP has strong independent endorsement of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (see [LLMChoice.md](../LLMChoice.md)) and Claude Code (with attributions in all docs).
- The project showcases the relevance of MCPs.
- The project showcases how ambitious MCPs can be.
- Claude Code's power as a coding assistant is showcased.
- Claude Code's power as a project planner, researcher and document drafter is showcased.
- The market is big enough ultimately to generate worthwhile token revenue for Anthropic.
- The project is a case study of how a human developer (BD) and Claude Code can collaborate, evidenced by todo.md and throughout the .mds, and the github commits.
- The project can accelerate Anthropic adoption in financial services, a key market.
- Participation in the FCA Super Sandbox will turbocharge Anthropic exposure â€“ BD first heard of the FCA Super Sandbox on Squawk Box, in connection with the search for AI use-cases, this indicates that executive interest in the wider topic is high (and Anthropic sponsorship will greatly increase likelihood of acceptance in the sandbox).
- The "Team = BD and Claude Code, feels like a team of dozens of tightly-knit and efficient executives" message is very eyecatching for such a substantial product, and usable for Anthropic marketing.
- It will be natural to use these points to work with Anthropic on marketing (blog posts, presentations, interviews) to mutual benefit.
