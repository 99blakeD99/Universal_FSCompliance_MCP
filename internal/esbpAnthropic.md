## Especially Suitable Business Partner

Anthropic is an Especially Suitable Business Partner. 

## README.md as a baseline validation

README.md - and its linked files is a baseline validation of a very powerful future product and a well-run project.

### Special Additional Attractions for Anthropic

- The public documentation pervasivel contains endorsement of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

- The project showcases the relevance of MCPs.

- The project showcases how ambitious MCPs can be.

- The project showcases Claude Code's power as an AI companion, as particularly outlined in OurStory.md.

- The project showcases Claude Code's power as a project planner, researcher and document drafter.

- The market is big enough ultimately to generate worthwhile token revenue for Anthropic.

- The project can accelerate Anthropic adoption in financial services, a key market.

- Participation in the upcoming FCA Super Sandbox will turbocharge Anthropic exposure.

- The project is a case study of how a human developer (BD) and Claude Code can collaborate, as portrayed extensively in OurStory.md.

- The OurStory.md highlights the "Team = BD and Claude Code, feels like a team of dozens of tightly-knit and efficient executives" message. This is a very eyecatching quote for Anthropic marketing.

- Generally our marketing messages can be leveraged by Anthropic for marketing (blog posts, presentations, interviews) to mutual benefit.
 
## What We Are Looking For

### Sponsorship

The project needs to meet running costs during its nascent state, running at £25,000 per month including the CEO's costs, arising from switching full time to this project. 

A fully structured funding basis is premature. 

What we are looking for is Anthropid sponsorship of this amount for six months, following which other funding arrangements can be reviewed.

### Joint Participation in the Upcoming FCA Super Sandbox

We would like to state that our application to the upcoming FCA Super Sandbox is sponsored by Anthropic.

This will increase the likelihood of being accepted, and get us and Anthropic a seat at an important table. Te effects will be:

- exposure to the UK Financial Institutions regulated by the FCA

- exposure to other jurisdictions' regulators, eg FDIC, SEC - and hence exposure to Financial Institutions regulated by them.
