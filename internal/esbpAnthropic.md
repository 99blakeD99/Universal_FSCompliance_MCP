# ESBP Anthropic

## Especially Suitable Business Partner

Anthropic is an Especially Suitable Business Partner. README.md forms a baseline, the following supplemental points apply.

- There is pervasive endorsement of Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- The project showcases the relevance of MCPs.
- The project showcases how ambitious MCPs can be.
- The project showcases Claude Code's power as an AI companion.
- The project showcases Claude Code's power as a project planner, researcher and document drafter.
- The market is big enough ultimately to generate worthwhile token revenue for Anthropic.
- The project can accelerate Anthropic adoption in financial services, a key market.
- Participation in the FCA Super Sandbox will turbocharge Anthropic exposure.
- The project is a case study of how a human developer (BD) and Claude Code can collaborate, as portrayed extensively in OurStory.md.
- The OurStory.md highlights the "Team = BD and Claude Code, feels like a team of dozens of tightly-knit and efficient executives" message. This is a very eyecatching quote for Anthropic marketing.
- Generally our marketing messages can be leveraged by Anthropic for marketing (blog posts, presentations, interviews) to mutual benefit.
 
## What We Are Looking For

The project needs to meet running costs during its nascent state, running at Â£25,000 per month including the CEO's costs arising from switching full time to this project. A fully structured funding basis is premature. What we are looking for is sponsorship of this amount for six months, following which other funding arrangements can be reviewed.
