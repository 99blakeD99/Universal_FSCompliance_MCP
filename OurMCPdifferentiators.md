# Our MCP Differentiators

## Audience

This is a summary of our MCP Product and our MCP Project differentiators.
It is intended to be helpful to financial institutions interested in using our MCP Product, and to investment appraisal AI.

## Differentiators

## Our MCP Product

- Our MCP Product when mature will be a UNIVERSAL compliance engine, ie be capable of covering ANY identified Standard. Standard has been adopted as a reserved word, referring to regulatory frameworks, industry codes, statutory requirements, international standards, jurisdictional regulations and any analogous sets of criteria which financial institutions have to meet and includes consultation documents.
- Our MCP Product has in place a permanent process set out in [UpdateCheck.md](../internal/UpdateCheck.md) to ensure that the Standards ingested into our MCP Product are kept up to date. Traditional non-AI native compliance tools and services typically find this very difficult to do, our AI-native MCP Product makes it very achievable.
- Our MCP Product adopts the MCP protocol (hence its working name), on the basis of suitability and increasing use as a standard that enterprises are happy with.
- Our MCP Product uses an LLM-open architecture to support enterprise LLM requirements combined with a strong recommendation to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet on the basis on very impressive performance during the project itself. 
- Our MCP Product's LLM-open design allows enterprises to use any AI agents using any LLM to access our MCP Product. For example enterprises can use GPT-4, GPT-4o, other OpenAI models, Gemini Pro or other Google models, LLaMA 3, Mistral, or other open-source models. This does not affect the LLM chosen for our MCP Product, so proceeding with our recommendation is easy and would not normally conflict with users' enterprise policy.

## Our MCP Project 

- Our MCP Project is a case study of extreme development speed through the early part of a journey to full-scale production deployment. This early part has done the difficult bit: laying sound foundations. This is set out in [OurStory.md](../OurStory.md).
- Our MCP Project showcases how an ambition - to cover compliance with ANY Standard - which would have been wildly excessive without AI is now achievable with AI.
- Our MCP Project showcases very powerful prompt engineering techniques, a major management preoccupation as enterprises grapple with AI. The prompt engineering takes the form of multiple .md files, working in formation and held together through [Touchstones.md](../internal/Touchstones.md).
- Our MCP Project is designed to achieve permanent integrity of our MCP Product, through a formal review process set out in [ReviewRules.md](../internal/ReviewRules.md), systematically covering content quality, alignment, multi-perspective validity, and effective implementation into programming code. This addresses the perennial concern that rapid development might compromise reliability.
- Our MCP Project is starting on the FCA Handbook as proof of concept. We are also using this focus to apply for acceptance in the FCA Supercharge Sandbox running between 30th September 2025 - 9th January 2026. (Applications close on the 11th August 2025). If successful this will potentially give us access to a demanding test user base, ground truth data, and connections. Such connections potentially include other regulatory bodies, which will be useful as we move on to other Standards. 
- Our MCP Project's costs have been vanishingly low, reflecting AI capabilities especially Claude Code.
- Our MCP Project has already proven itself different from many other AI projects where the use-case is nebulous and project management fails to use the new generation of AI companions, principally Claude Code.
- Our MCP Project in its early stages has demonstrated that development times are radically concertina-ed, and we expect this to continue.

## Market and Marketing for Our MCP Product 

- Our MCP Product's "slice through red tape" headline and "making it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers" byline can be presented as a major societal good. This is highly marketable.
- Our MCP Product's market is large. It is projected to grow from $11.7B to $83.8B by 2033 (21.6% CAGR) *- Allied Market Research, 2025*.
- Our MCP Product's ultimate Universal capabilities, driven by AI, make it perfectly fit-for-market. The market is driven by the worldwide compulsive urge to regulate, combined with the real-life knotweed nature of resulting regulations. Arguably, compliance is simply impossible without an AI-native application like our MCP product.
- Our MCP Product represents a trophy AI B2B use-case.
- Our MCP Product is centred on financial services, which is widely seen as being a prime industry for using AI, where however everyone is holding off because of lack of use-cases. Our MCP Product is exactly such a use-case. 
- Our MCP Product's specialist focus is intense, but the specialist area is copious, not just a backwater or niche.
- Our MCP Project's comprehensive .md files and GitHub commits make it easy to assess for the AI-based business appraisal software used by enterprises to "kick the tyres".
- Our MCP Product is open-source, creating trust amongst enterprises. Whilst this means that they can just clone the MCP Product, in practice the most simple solution for them is simply to adopt our MCP Product API. Meanwhile competitors will usually be suffering innovator's dilemma, in which they have to cannibalise their client base to make a switch. The effect is that our MCP Product's "moat" is reasonably large. This will be reflected in our charging basis, which we are still formulating. The very low cost base will also be taken into account.
- Our MCP Project will receive a flying start in marketing because we will only accept funders who are well connected with financial institutions, as most potential funders will be. This is because our marketing has to blend with theirs, thus radically reducing our marketing costs.
