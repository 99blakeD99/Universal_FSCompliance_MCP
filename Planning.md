# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project Planning Document

## Executive Summary

**Key Deliverable**: Production-ready AI Agent Oriented multi-server MCP architecture with mcp-server-fca-compliance as first implementation and systematic expansion methodology

## Technical Constraints

Critical constraints for financial services regulatory compliance platform:
- **Technology**: Must use open-source technologies and MCP protocol  
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security for sensitive financial data
- **Architecture**: AI Agent Oriented multi-server approach with standard-specific MCP servers

## Project Scope

### Included:
- AI Agent Oriented multi-server MCP architecture with JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance
- mcp-server-fca-compliance as first standard-specific server with FCA Handbook integration
- Universal Standards Engine methodology for systematic expansion to new regulatory frameworks
- 7 core compliance analysis tools with standard-specific prefixing (FCA_quickly_check_compliance, etc.)
- Two-layer semantic matching optimized for structured regulatory content
- Database architecture with standard-specific table prefixes (single database, multiple prefixes)
- Enterprise security features (OAuth 2.1, TLS encryption, role-based access)
- StandardImplementMCP.md methodology for future standard implementation

### Excluded:
- Implementation of Standards beyond FCA Handbook in initial release (MiFID, SEC, Basel deferred to Phase 4+)
- Custom enterprise consulting or professional services
- Mobile application development
- Integration with legacy technologies (beyond standard APIs)
- Graph database capabilities (determined unnecessary for structured regulatory content)

## Quality Standards

- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, <2 second response time
- **Security**: OWASP compliance, regular audits
- **Accuracy**: 75% initial → 85% production → 95% long-term

## Key Technical Constraints

- **Dependencies**: MCP protocol stability, configurable LLM provider APIs
- **Architecture Risk**: Multi-server complexity (fallback: single-server if needed)
- **Performance Risk**: Cross-server bottlenecks (mitigation: per-server optimization)
