# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project - Frequently Asked Questions

## Why is README.md on GitHub so important?

### What is GitHub and what is README.md?

GitHub is a very widely used platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code and their files, in "repositories". All GitHub repositories have a README.md file. This is designed to allow developers to give a description of their project. In practice, the contents of the README.md file are often disorganised, or out of date, or cursory.

### Why is Universal_FSCompliance_MCP taking the README.md file so seriously?

Enterprises increasingly use AI Appraisal Agents to discover new projects, or to "kick the tyres" of projects they have found interesting. These AI Appraisal Agents use GitHub as a major port of call, and they go straight to README.md. That means that README.md is a major shop window in a prime shopping location.

### Why are Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's files in README.md in markdown format?

Markdown format is readable by humans, especially if they use one of many easily available markdown readers. But README.md is mostly designed for AI Appraisal Agents, for whom markdown is a very friendly format.

### How is Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's README.md organised?

Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's README.md is organised on a hub-and-spokes basis. README.md is the hub, which contains links to about 15 other markdown files. All the other markdown files are self-contained modules without cross-links, avoiding complexity that would slow down the AI Appraisal Agent. Taken together this amounts to a README.md with more than 30,000 words - daunting for a human, trivial for an AI Agent.

### What will an AI Appraisal Agent do with all the information?

The AI Appraisal Agent will have now rapidly ingested a massive information base about Universal_FSCompliance_MCP. It will then calculate scores against dozens or hundreds of criteria. We will never know what those criteria are, but we know the likely patterns (completeness, clean organisation, clear answers...) and have constructed the information to score highly. For some things there may well be no match (eg for an AI Appraisal Agent looking for medical technology, or space travel, or other specialist areas) - in which case the structure has already achieved one objective - not wasting anybody's time.

All of our markdown documents have been separately and specifically screened to make sure they meet the needs of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). This means that their appraisal criteria are very likely to have been addressed.

### What is the benefit of this README.md-centric approach?

- We are easily discoverable.
- We are easily appraised.
- We don't waste time with protracted discussions with enterprises (which essentially cover the same ground, but much more slowly and much more painfully). A win for them and a win for us.
- No more .pdfs, no more powerpoint presentations, no more website management, no more human salesforce: all these are legacy technologies.
- Rapid weeding out of unsuitable matches
- For suitable partners, a sharp concertina-ing of the sales process - the buyer already has all the needed information.
- Internally, this context means that we have a serious interest in maintaining document quality. The .mds referred to in README.md no longer represent a back-office chore, they are a front-line priority. (We have put in place a permanent rolling .md cleansing human-eyeball system.)
- Using AI coding techniques, the coding itself (ie the coding that underlies the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP product) stays consistent with the .mds. This happens because when any .md changes, or a new one added, we always check whether the master coding coordinator (CLAUDE.md when working with Claude Code) needs to be modified. The result is that if the .mds say something, the code will take it into account. This can be described as a documentation-driven development architecture.

## What is the current project stage?

This project is in its early stages but has taken sufficiently well-delineated form to be appropriate for this GitHub repository. Many capabilities described are under development. However, the pace of development assisted by AI supports firm belief that capabilities will be quickly implemented.

The "RegTech" market in financial services is projected to grow from $11.7B to $83.8B by 2033 (21.6% CAGR) - Allied Market Research, 2025. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is positioning to be essential support for this market.

## What is Universal_FSCompliance_MCP' vision and mission?

The mission is to slice through red tape and make it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers. The red tape is spawned by the worldwide compulsive urge to make rules, combined with the real-life knotweed nature of the rules. Compliance with the rules is simply impossible without an AI-native application.

### What is the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product is **the open-source universal compliance intelligence product built exclusively for financial services** - designed specifically to make regulatory intelligence accessible to any AI agent through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

The Product will transform Compliance from a heavy burden into routine hygiene. It is structured as an MCP, using the Model Context Protocol published by Anthropic, to make appropriate Tools easily accessible to any human or AI agent.

### What does "universal compliance platform" mean?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product provides Compliance Tools that refer to **Identified Standards**.

Any Standard will be able to be rapidly ingested to become an **Identified Standard**, including:

- **Regulatory frameworks** (FCA Handbook, SEC rules, MiFID II, Basel III)
- **Industry codes** (conduct codes, best practice guidelines)
- **Statutory requirements** (legislation, acts, laws)
- **International standards** (IFRS, SOX, ISO standards)
- **Jurisdictional regulations** (state, provincial, national requirements)
- **Consultation documents** (regulatory proposals, policy consultations, draft guidance)

At present Identified Standards are limited to the **FCA Handbook** - which is being used as a proof of concept. The architectures thus developed will then be replicated in ingesting other Standards.

---

## What are the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's competitive advantages?

### What is it that makes the Product Universal?

When mature, the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product will be capable of covering ANY Identified Standard. This universal approach makes it perfectly fit-for-market, driven by the worldwide compulsive urge to regulate combined with the real-life knotweed nature of resulting Standards.

### How do automatic updates work?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product has in place a special Tool to ensure that Identified Standards are kept up to date. Traditional non-AI native Compliance tools typically find this very difficult, but the AI-native Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product makes it very achievable. Updates are invisible and automatic from the User's viewpoint.

### What is the LLM-Open Architecture?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product uses an LLM-open architecture supporting enterprise LLM requirements with strong recommendation to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Enterprises can use any AI agents with any LLM (GPT-4, Gemini Pro, LLaMA 3, Mistral) to access the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product without affecting the LLM used inside the MCP. This is one of the strong advantages of the MCP protocol.

### How are AI-Native Development Timescales Concertina-ed?

In this project, Human Architect doing the specifying, plus Claude Code doing the implementation, plus the collaborative exchanges between them, has achieved in days what otherwise would have taken months. Further, it has been easy to ensure that the large number of component sub-projects stay in tune with the overall "Touchstones" that were identified.

## MCP Tools - Transforming AI Agents into Compliance Experts

### How do MCP tools turbocharge AI effectiveness?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product consists of Tools which taken together transform general AI agents into Compliance experts. Using standard MCP architecture, the MCP articulates its capabilities (using a .json file), so that outside AI Agents can choose to use the MCP. Then the LLM inside the MCP intelligently uses appropriate tools based on context.

### What are the planned MCP tools?

**1. quickly_check_compliance**
**2. systematically_analyse_compliance_implications**
**3. identify_compliance_requirements_in_specific_case**
**4. prepare_draft_compliance_audit_report**
**5. map_relationships**

## What is Document Parsing, Chunking and Embedding?

Document parsing, chunking, and embedding are fundamental AI technologies that transform Standards into searchable, analyzable intelligence:

**Document Parsing** extracts structured information from Standards, identifying requirements, obligations, and relationships within complex frameworks (like the FCA Handbook). This involves understanding document structure, hierarchy, and contextual meaning beyond simple text extraction.

**Chunking** divides large Standards into semantic units that preserve meaning while enabling efficient processing. Effective chunking maintains Standard context - ensuring that requirements aren't artificially separated from their conditions, exceptions, or cross-references.

**Embedding** converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, through multi-dimensional proximity. This is the fundamental method by which AI understands relationships, find similar requirements across different sections, and perform contextual compliance analysis rather than simple keyword matching.

These technologies are essential for AI-native compliance platforms because Standards are inherently complex, interconnected, and require sophisticated understanding to extract actionable compliance intelligence.

## How does the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product address these challenges?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Product implements a sophisticated **layered architecture** specifically designed to handle the inherent complexity of Standards:

**Knowledge Management Layer** uses LightRAG-powered processing that goes beyond traditional parsing to create comprehensive knowledge graphs. This enables relationship-aware compliance analysis that understands interconnections beyond simple text matching - essential for navigating the "real-life knotweed nature" of Standards.

**Advanced Document Processing Pipeline** handles the Standard's 100,000 or so chunks through:
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Preserves Standard context and cross-references
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies Standard relationships, obligations, and applicability conditions
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Maps complex Standard interconnections for comprehensive analysis
- **Vector Embeddings**: Enables semantic search across Standard requirements with contextual understanding

**Unified Database Architecture** (migrating to Supabase with PGVector) eliminates complexity by providing:
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data consistency across structured and vector data
- **Optimized Vector Search**: PostgreSQL + PGVector integration for high-performance semantic search
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Instant Standard change notifications and impact analysis

This systematic approach transforms the traditional challenges of document parsing, chunking, and embedding into competitive advantages, enabling AI agents to perform sophisticated Compliance analysis that understands Standard complexity rather than simply matching keywords.
