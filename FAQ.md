# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project - Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Universal_FSCompliance_MCP' vision and mission?

The vision and mission is to enable Financial Institutions to slice through red tape and make it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers. The red tape is spawned by the worldwide compulsive urge to make rules, combined with the real-life knotweed nature of the rules. Compliance with the rules is simply impossible without an AI-native application.

## What is the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project?

### Overview

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is a suite of MCP servers available to any AI agent through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. It starts with the FCA Handbook to create mcp-server-fca-compliance, containing tools such as FCA_quickly_check_compliance and others. Other MCP servers will follow, using similar methods and using similar architectures. 

The Project is structured and denominated in this way because of the way that semantics underpin the operation of AI, AI Agents, and Tools. AI Agents will use MCP servers and Tools which are semantically weighted in accordance with usage and the originating prompt. In our example the expected behaviour of the LLM being used by the AI Agent would be, as an example:

- I am being prompted: "Does the attached policy wording comply with FCA requirements?"
  
- Look, when I was constructed I was given access to an MCP server called mcp-server-fca-compliance - that looks very relevant.
  
- Look, there is a Tool called FCA_quickly_check_compliance, that looks like a semantic match, it contains "FCA", it contains "Compliance" and I think from the prompt that the User wants a quick check, I'll use that Tool.
  
- Here is what the Tool returned, I'll use that to frame a response to the User, take it from there.

Because of the quality and accuracy of our specialist Tools, Compliance will be converted from a heavy burden into routine hygiene. 

### What does "Universal" mean?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is universal in the sense of being capable of applying to any **Implemented Standards**.

Any Standard which is sufficiently structured (i.e. with coherent headings) will be able to be rapidly ingested to become an **Implemented Standard**, including:

- **Regulatory frameworks** (FCA Handbook, SEC rules, MiFID II, Basel III)
- **Industry codes** (conduct codes, best practice guidelines)
- **Statutory requirements** (legislation, acts, laws)
- **International standards** (IFRS, SOX, ISO standards)
- **Jurisdictional regulations** (state, provincial, national requirements)
- **Consultation documents** (regulatory proposals, policy consultations, draft guidance)

At present Implemented Standards are limited to the **FCA Handbook** - which is being used as a proof of concept. The architectures thus developed will then be replicated in ingesting other Standards.

## What is the market size?

The "RegTech" market in financial services is projected to grow from $11.7B to $83.8B by 2033 (21.6% CAGR) - Allied Market Research, 2025. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is positioning to be essential support for this market.

## What is the current state of the Project?

This Project is in its early stages but has quickly taken well-delineated form. The current state is: 

- Preparation. Complete. Comprehensive documentation covering Business, Technical, and Technological matters in multiple discrete modules as outlined in README.md
  
- Stage 1. Complete. mcp-server-fca-compliance submitted to Anthropic's MCP ecosystem Official Integrations, awaiting review. This is a skeletal implementation designed to secure semantic positioning ready for Users' AI Agents, and provide a tested framework which we can then use to deploy full Tool functionality.
  
- Stage 2 In progress. Development of full Tool functionality. Strategic organization completed. Basic Tool coding well advanced. Dashboard statistics structure completed. LLM-open capability structure completed. Charging framework structure completed.
  
- Subsequent Stages. As per rollout set out in MinimumViableProposition.md.

The Project is thus a test case of ultra-rapid large-scale development using new AI tools.

## Why is README.md on GitHub so important?

### What is GitHub and what is README.md?

GitHub is a very widely used platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code and their files, in "repositories". All GitHub repositories have a README.md file. This is designed to allow developers to give a description of their project. In practice, the contents of the README.md file are often disorganised, or out of date, or cursory.

### Why is Universal_FSCompliance_MCP taking the README.md file so seriously?

Enterprises increasingly use AI Appraisal Agents to discover new projects, or to "kick the tyres" of projects they have found interesting. These AI Appraisal Agents use GitHub as a major port of call, and they go straight to README.md. That means that README.md is a major shop window in a prime shopping location.

### Why are Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's files in README.md in markdown format?

Markdown format is readable by humans, especially if they use one of many easily available markdown readers. But README.md is mostly designed for AI Appraisal Agents, for whom markdown is a very friendly format.

### How is Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's README.md organised?

Universal_FSCompliance_MCP's README.md is organised on a hub-and-spokes basis. README.md is the hub, which contains links to about 15 other markdown files. All the other markdown files are self-contained modules without cross-links, avoiding complexity that would slow down the AI Appraisal Agent. Taken together this amounts to a README.md with more than 30,000 words - daunting for a human, trivial for an AI Agent.

### What will an AI Appraisal Agent do with all the information?

The AI Appraisal Agent will have now rapidly ingested a massive information base about Universal_FSCompliance_MCP. It will then calculate scores against dozens or hundreds of criteria. We will never know what those criteria are, but we know the likely patterns (completeness, clean organisation, clear answers...) and have constructed the information to score highly. For some things there may well be no match (eg for an AI Appraisal Agent looking for medical technology, or space travel, or other specialist areas) - in which case the structure has already achieved one objective - not wasting anybody's time.

All of our markdown documents have been separately and specifically screened to make sure they meet the needs of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), and the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). This means that their appraisal criteria are very likely to have been addressed.

### What is the benefit of this README.md-centric approach?

- We are easily discoverable.
  
- We are easily appraised.
  
- We don't waste time with protracted discussions with enterprises (which essentially cover the same ground, but much more slowly and much more painfully). A win for them and a win for us.
  
- No more .pdfs, no more powerpoint presentations, no more pitchdecks, no more website management, no more human salesforce: all these are legacy technologies.
  
- Rapid weeding out of unsuitable matches.
  
- For suitable partners, a sharp concertina-ing of the sales process - the buyer already has all the needed information.
  
- Internally, this context means that we have a serious interest in maintaining document quality. The .mds referred to in README.md no longer represent a back-office chore, they are a front-line priority. (We have put in place a permanent rolling .md cleansing human-eyeball system.)

- Using AI coding techniques, the coding itself (ie the coding that underlies the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project) stays consistent with the .mds. This happens because when any .md changes, or a new one added, we always check whether the master coding coordinator (CLAUDE.md when working with Claude Code) needs to be modified. The result is that if the .mds say something, the code will take it into account. This can be described as a documentation-driven development architecture.

## What are other factors to take into account?

### How do automatic updates work?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project has in place a special Tool to ensure that Implemented Standards are kept up to date. Traditional non-AI native Compliance tools typically find this very difficult, but the AI-native Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project makes it very achievable. Updates are invisible and automatic from the User's viewpoint.

### What is the LLM-Open Architecture?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project uses an LLM-open architecture supporting enterprise LLM requirements with configurable provider selection. Enterprises can use any AI agents with any LLM (GPT-4, Gemini Pro, LLaMA 3, Mistral) to access the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's MCP servers without affecting the LLM used inside each MCP server. This is one of the strong advantages of the MCP protocol.

### How are AI-Native Development Timescales Concertina-ed?

In this Project, Human Architect doing the specifying, plus Claude Code doing the implementation, plus the collaborative exchanges between them, has achieved in days what otherwise would have taken many months. Further, it has been easy to ensure that the large number of component sub-projects stay in tune with the overall "Touchstones" that were identified.

### How do Tools work?

Using standard MCP architecture, each MCP server articulates its capabilities (using a .json file), so that outside AI Agents can choose to use the appropriate MCP server. Then the LLM inside each MCP server intelligently uses appropriate Tools based on context.

## What are the core MCP Tools?

Each standard-specific MCP server implements these Tools with regulatory prefixing (e.g., FCA_quickly_check_compliance):

**1. [STANDARD]_quickly_check_compliance** - Rapid compliance assessment for policy conceptualization

**2. [STANDARD]_identify_compliance_requirements_in_specific_case** - Context-specific regulatory requirement extraction  

**3. [STANDARD]_systematically_analyse_compliance_implications** - Comprehensive strategic compliance analysis

**4. [STANDARD]_suggest_remediation** - AI-powered gap-specific remediation recommendations

**5. [STANDARD]_prepare_draft_compliance_audit_report** - Professional audit documentation preparation

**6. [STANDARD]_validate_ground_truth** - Enterprise-grade validation and benchmarking

**7. [STANDARD]_status_of_standard_ingestion** - System status and regulatory content coverage visibility

**Future MCP Tools**

- **ingest_new_identified_standard** - Enable user-driven standard ingestion (pending regulatory framework stabilization)

- **update_implemented_standard** - Monitor and apply changes to maintain system currency

## What is the legal liability framework?

### What are the user responsibility and professional oversight requirements?

**Users retain full legal and regulatory responsibility for all Compliance decisions, actions, and outcomes.** The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's MCP servers serve as analytical tools to assist decision-making but do not replace professional judgment or legal accountability.

**Professional Requirements:**
- All Compliance activities must be supervised by appropriately qualified professionals
- AI-generated content may contain errors and requires human review and validation
- Users should ensure IT systems maintain permanent records of Tool usage and professional review

**Technology Platform Disclaimer:**
The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's MCP servers provide information and analysis but do not constitute legal advice, regulatory guidance, or Compliance recommendations. Users must ensure Compliance with data protection regulations and obtain necessary permissions for data processing activities.

## What is the technical architecture?

### What is the core architecture?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project implements AI Agent Oriented multi-server architecture:

**Cloud Deployment Benefits:**
- **Instant setup** - Ready without infrastructure planning
- **Automatic updates** - Latest features and regulatory updates
- **Professional support** - Assistance and monitoring
- **Proven reliability** - Managed infrastructure and scaling

### What is the business model?

**Freemium Structure:**

Currently a freemium structure is envisaged:

- **Community Edition**: Basic Compliance checking with FCA Handbook
- **Professional Edition**: Advanced tools, priority support, additional Standards
- **Enterprise Edition**: Self-hosted options, custom integrations, dedicated support

**Pricing Philosophy:**

The MCP server costs represents a tiny part of Users' overall Compliance costs, so demand will be price-inelastic. Token-based charging structure at level to be determined through market research.

## What is Document Parsing, Chunking and Embedding?

Document parsing, chunking, and embedding are fundamental AI technologies that transform Standards into searchable, analyzable intelligence:

**Document Parsing** extracts structured information from Standards, identifying requirements, obligations, and relationships within complex frameworks (like the FCA Handbook). This involves understanding document structure, hierarchy, and contextual meaning beyond simple text extraction.

**Chunking** divides large Standards into semantic units that preserve meaning while enabling efficient processing. Effective chunking maintains Standard context - ensuring that requirements aren't artificially separated from their conditions, exceptions, or cross-references.

**Embedding** converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, through multi-dimensional proximity. This is the fundamental method by which AI understands relationships, find similar requirements across different sections, and perform contextual compliance analysis rather than simple keyword matching.

These technologies are essential for AI-native compliance platforms because Standards are inherently complex, interconnected, and require sophisticated understanding to extract actionable compliance intelligence.

## How does the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project address these challenges?

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project implements a sophisticated **layered architecture** specifically designed to handle the inherent complexity of Standards:

**Knowledge Management Layer** uses LightRAG-powered processing that goes beyond traditional parsing to create comprehensive knowledge graphs. This enables relationship-aware compliance analysis that understands interconnections beyond simple text matching - essential for navigating the "real-life knotweed nature" of Standards.

**Advanced Document Processing Pipeline** handles the Standard's 100,000 or so chunks through:
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Preserves Standard context and cross-references
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies Standard relationships, obligations, and applicability conditions
- **Vector Embeddings**: Enables semantic search across Standard requirements with contextual understanding

**Unified Database Architecture** (migrating to Supabase with PGVector) eliminates complexity by providing:
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data consistency across structured and vector data
- **Optimized Vector Search**: PostgreSQL + PGVector integration for high-performance semantic search
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Instant Standard change notifications and impact analysis

This systematic approach transforms the traditional challenges of document parsing, chunking, and embedding into competitive advantages, enabling AI agents to perform sophisticated Compliance analysis that understands Standard complexity rather than simply matching keywords.
