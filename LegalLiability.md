# Legal Liability Framework

## Executive Summary

This document sets out how the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project ("UFSCMCP") manages legal liability.

This is important because clarity is needed on:

- whilst the MCP servers and their tools are designed to achieve the overarching objective of making it easier for Financial Institutions to bring the right product safely to consumers
- Usage is still  subject to human review and validation, supervised by appropriately qualified professionals.

## User Responsibility 

Final Responsibility: Users retain full legal and regulatory responsibility for all Compliance decisions, actions, and outcomes. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project provides analytical Tools to assist decision-making but does not over-ride Users' professional judgment or legal accountability.

Professional Oversight: Users must ensure that all Compliance activities are supervised by appropriately qualified Compliance professionals with relevant knowledge and authority. They are responsible for taking into account context, business circumstances, and general requirements in using the Tools, and in making use of Tool outputs.

Information Tool Only: The Tools provide information and analysis but output does not constitute legal advice, regulatory guidance, or Compliance recommendations.

No Warranty of Accuracy: While the Product aims for accuracy, no warranty is provided regarding the completeness, currency, or applicability of any information or analysis provided.

User Senior Management Responsibilities: User senior management must recognise that: management cannot be delegated to AI systems; Compliance oversight remains a core management responsibility; AI tools must be subject to appropriate governance and control frameworks, which may differ depending on jurisdiction.

### Data and Privacy Responsibilities

Notwithstanding that the Tools use architectures which support data privacy and confidentiality, Users are responsible for:

- Ensuring Compliance with data protection regulations when using the Tools

- Managing confidentiality and anonymity of proprietary information shared with the Tools 
  
- Obtaining necessary permissions for data shared with the Tools

## Operational Reinforcement

Key liability reminders will be integrated through:

- Initial acceptance of liability terms before Tool access

- Periodic reinforcement notifications during extended sessions

- Warnings for what are judged by the Tool LLM to be high-risk activities

## Records of Use

Users are encouraged to ensure that their IT is set up in such a way as to maintain permanent records of:

- Tool usage and outputs for Compliance audit purposes

- Professional review and validation of AI-generated recommendations

- Decision-making processes and rationale for Compliance actions

## System Limitations

No warranty is provided regarding system availability or response times. 

Users are encouraged to report system issues through established support channels to enable continuous improvement and risk management.
