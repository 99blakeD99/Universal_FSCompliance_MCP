# Database Architecture Strategy

*AI Agent Oriented database design for the Universal Standards Engine*

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the database architecture for the Universal Standards Engine, designed to optimize AI Agent discovery and interaction through standard-specific semantic boundaries while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance requirements.

**Primary Architecture Decision**: Single database with standard-specific table prefixes, enabling AI Agent Oriented tool design while simplifying infrastructure management.

---

## AI Agent Oriented Database Requirements

The Universal Standards Engine serves AI agents responding to compliance queries with maximum semantic significance for specific regulatory standards (e.g., "Does [situation] comply with FCA requirements?"). The database architecture must support this AI Agent Oriented approach through:

**Semantic Clarity**: Clear data boundaries matching regulatory contexts that AI agents understand
**Tool Isolation**: Each standard-specific MCP server queries only its relevant data sets
**Discoverability**: Database structure that reinforces the semantic anchoring principle
**Performance**: Efficient queries supporting two-layer semantic matching architecture

---

## Database Architecture: Single Database with Table Prefixes

The AI Agent Oriented architecture with separate MCP servers per standard requires careful database design to maintain performance, security, and operational efficiency.

### Core Structure

Rather than creating separate databases for each standard, we adopt a unified database with standard-specific table prefixes:

**Standard-Specific Tables:**
- **FCA Tables**: `fca_documents`, `fca_ground_truth`, `fca_ingestion_status`
- **MiFID Tables**: `mifid_documents`, `mifid_ground_truth`, `mifid_ingestion_status`  
- **SEC Tables**: `sec_documents`, `sec_ground_truth`, `sec_ingestion_status`

**Shared Infrastructure Tables:**
- `standards_registry`: Catalog of implemented standards and their status
- `system_config`: Global configuration parameters
- `user_access_control`: Cross-standard user permissions and access policies

### Schema Design for Two-Layer Semantic Matching

Each standard-specific document table supports the two-layer semantic matching architecture:

```sql
-- Example: FCA documents table
CREATE TABLE fca_documents (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    section_reference TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Layer 1: Semantic anchor (e.g., "COBS")
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    embedding VECTOR(768),            -- Layer 2: Vector similarity search
    metadata JSONB,
    ingestion_level TEXT,            -- 'full' or 'heading_only' for unified approach
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Ground truth table for enterprise validation
CREATE TABLE fca_ground_truth (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    regulatory_reference TEXT,
    confidence_level TEXT,
    owner_organization TEXT,        -- Data ownership and access control
    public_access BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Ingestion status tracking for AI agent visibility
CREATE TABLE fca_ingestion_status (
    section_reference TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,           -- 'completed', 'pending', 'partial'
    word_count INTEGER,
    chunk_count INTEGER,
    coverage_level TEXT,            -- 'full', 'heading_only', 'not_ingested'
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### AI Agent Focused Design
Each MCP server (e.g., FCA_Compliance_MCP) queries only its own table set, providing clear semantic boundaries that match regulatory contexts. This enables AI agents to:
- Match semantic anchors directly to data sources
- Avoid cross-contamination between regulatory standards
- Maintain clear tool-to-data relationships

### Operational Efficiency
Single database connection, unified backup procedures, centralized monitoring, and simplified infrastructure management reduce operational complexity while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.

### Data Isolation with Infrastructure Unity
Clear separation between standards prevents data mixing while enabling shared infrastructure and cross-standard analysis when needed. Ground truth data can be isolated by standard and organization.

### Ground Truth Integration
Natural pattern for standard-specific ground truth tables with appropriate access controls per user/owner requirements. Supports both public ground truth (industry consensus) and private ground truth (organization-specific Q&A).

### Scalability and Performance
Adding new standards requires only creating new table sets following the established naming convention. Vector operations remain efficient through standard-specific embedding spaces and optimized indexing.

## Implementation Considerations

### Current System Migration
**Phase 1**: Rename existing tables from generic names to `fca_*` prefix to establish the pattern
**Phase 2**: Update existing FCA_Compliance_MCP server to query prefixed tables exclusively
**Phase 3**: Validate performance and data integrity after migration

### Query Isolation Strategy
Each MCP server connects to the same database but queries only its prefixed tables, maintaining logical separation:

```python
# Example: FCA_Compliance_MCP server query pattern
class FCAComplianceAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.table_prefix = "fca_"
        
    async def search_documents(self, query: str):
        # Only queries fca_documents table
        return await self.db.query(
            f"SELECT * FROM {self.table_prefix}documents WHERE ..."
        )
```

### Schema Evolution and Standards Management
Table schema changes can be applied per standard, allowing different regulatory frameworks to have specialized fields while sharing common patterns. The `standards_registry` table maintains metadata about each implemented standard:

```sql
CREATE TABLE standards_registry (
    standard_tag TEXT PRIMARY KEY,        -- 'fca', 'mifid', 'sec'
    standard_name TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'FCA Handbook', 'MiFID II'
    mcp_server_name TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'FCA_Compliance_MCP'
    database_tables TEXT[],               -- ['fca_documents', 'fca_ground_truth']
    ingestion_status TEXT,                -- 'active', 'planned', 'deprecated'
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Access Control and Security
User permissions can be managed at the table level, enabling fine-grained access to specific standards or ground truth datasets. Row-level security policies can be applied per standard:

```sql
-- Example: Row-level security for FCA ground truth
ALTER TABLE fca_ground_truth ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY fca_ground_truth_access ON fca_ground_truth
FOR SELECT USING (
    public_access = true OR 
    owner_organization = current_user_organization()
);
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy for Two-Layer Matching
```sql
-- Layer 1: Semantic anchor indexing
CREATE INDEX fca_documents_section_idx ON fca_documents (section_reference);

-- Layer 2: Vector similarity indexing
CREATE INDEX fca_documents_embedding_idx ON fca_documents 
USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops);

-- Combined performance optimization
CREATE INDEX fca_documents_section_embedding_idx ON fca_documents 
(section_reference, embedding);
```

### Query Patterns for AI Agent Tools
```sql
-- Typical AI agent query: Layer 1 + Layer 2 semantic matching
SELECT d.*, d.embedding <=> %s::vector AS similarity
FROM fca_documents d
WHERE d.section_reference = %s  -- Layer 1: Semantic anchor
ORDER BY d.embedding <=> %s::vector  -- Layer 2: Vector similarity
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Future Standards Integration

### Template Approach for New Standards
When implementing new regulatory standards, the database structure follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Create standard-specific tables** following naming convention
2. **Update standards_registry** with new standard metadata
3. **Implement standard-specific ground truth** tables if available
4. **Configure access controls** appropriate to regulatory requirements

### Cross-Standard Analysis Capabilities
While AI agents operate within standard-specific boundaries, the unified database enables cross-standard analysis for advanced use cases:

```sql
-- Example: Cross-standard regulatory overlap analysis
SELECT 
    f.section_reference AS fca_section,
    m.section_reference AS mifid_section,
    f.embedding <=> m.embedding AS similarity
FROM fca_documents f
CROSS JOIN mifid_documents m
WHERE f.embedding <=> m.embedding < 0.3  -- High similarity threshold
ORDER BY similarity;
```

    SUBSTRING(tool_used FROM '^([A-Z]+)_') AS regulatory_standard,
    tool_used,
    heading1,
    COUNT(*) as usage_count,
    AVG(response_confidence) as avg_confidence,
    AVG(processing_time_ms) as avg_processing_time,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN content_type = 'boundary_message' THEN 1 END) as boundary_messages
FROM fca_tool_usage  -- Union with other standard tables
GROUP BY regulatory_standard, tool_used, heading1;
```
