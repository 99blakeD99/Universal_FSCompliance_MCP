# Database Architecture Strategy

*AI Agent Oriented database design for the Universal Standards Engine*

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the database architecture for the Universal Standards Engine, designed to optimize AI Agent discovery and interaction through standard-specific semantic boundaries while maintaining operational efficiency and regulatory compliance requirements.

**Primary Architecture Decision**: Single database with standard-specific table prefixes, enabling AI Agent Oriented tool design while simplifying infrastructure management.

---

## AI Agent Oriented Database Requirements

The Universal Standards Engine serves AI agents responding to compliance queries with maximum semantic significance for specific regulatory standards (e.g., "Does [situation] comply with FCA requirements?"). The database architecture must support this AI Agent Oriented approach through:

**Semantic Clarity**: Clear data boundaries matching regulatory contexts that AI agents understand
**Tool Isolation**: Each standard-specific MCP server queries only its relevant data sets
**Discoverability**: Database structure that reinforces the semantic anchoring principle
**Performance**: Efficient queries supporting two-layer semantic matching architecture

---

## Database Architecture: Single Database with Table Prefixes

The AI Agent Oriented architecture with separate MCP servers per standard requires careful database design to maintain performance, security, and operational efficiency.

### Core Structure

Rather than creating separate databases for each standard, we adopt a unified database with standard-specific table prefixes:

**Standard-Specific Tables:**
- **FCA Tables**: `fca_documents`, `fca_ground_truth`, `fca_ingestion_status`
- **MiFID Tables**: `mifid_documents`, `mifid_ground_truth`, `mifid_ingestion_status`  
- **SEC Tables**: `sec_documents`, `sec_ground_truth`, `sec_ingestion_status`

**Shared Infrastructure Tables:**
- `standards_registry`: Catalog of implemented standards and their status
- `system_config`: Global configuration parameters
- `user_access_control`: Cross-standard user permissions and access policies

### Schema Design for Two-Layer Semantic Matching

Each standard-specific document table supports the two-layer semantic matching architecture:

Each standard-specific document table supports the two-layer semantic matching architecture with fields for ID, section reference (Layer 1 semantic anchor like "COBS"), title, content, vector embedding (Layer 2 similarity search), metadata, and ingestion level tracking. Ground truth tables capture enterprise validation data with questions, answers, regulatory references, confidence levels, and organization ownership controls. Ingestion status tables track section coverage with completion status, word counts, chunk counts, and coverage levels.

## Benefits of This Approach

### AI Agent Focused Design
Each MCP server (e.g., FCA_Compliance_MCP) queries only its own table set, providing clear semantic boundaries that match regulatory contexts. This enables AI agents to:
- Match semantic anchors directly to data sources
- Avoid cross-contamination between regulatory standards
- Maintain clear tool-to-data relationships

### Operational Efficiency
Single database connection, unified backup procedures, centralized monitoring, and simplified infrastructure management reduce operational complexity while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.

### Data Isolation with Infrastructure Unity
Clear separation between standards prevents data mixing while enabling shared infrastructure and cross-standard analysis when needed. Ground truth data can be isolated by standard and organization.

### Ground Truth Integration
Natural pattern for standard-specific ground truth tables with appropriate access controls per user/owner requirements. Supports both public ground truth (industry consensus) and private ground truth (organization-specific Q&A).

### Scalability and Performance
Adding new standards requires only creating new table sets following the established naming convention. Vector operations remain efficient through standard-specific embedding spaces and optimized indexing.

## Implementation Considerations

### Current System Migration
**Phase 1**: Rename existing tables from generic names to `fca_*` prefix to establish the pattern
**Phase 2**: Update existing FCA_Compliance_MCP server to query prefixed tables exclusively
**Phase 3**: Validate performance and data integrity after migration

### Query Isolation Strategy
Each MCP server connects to the same database but queries only its prefixed tables, maintaining logical separation:

Each MCP server connects to the same database but queries only its prefixed tables, maintaining logical separation. For example, the FCA_Compliance_MCP server uses "fca_" prefix and only queries FCA-specific tables, ensuring clean semantic boundaries.

### Schema Evolution and Standards Management
Table schema changes can be applied per standard, allowing different regulatory frameworks to have specialized fields while sharing common patterns. The `standards_registry` table maintains metadata about each implemented standard:

The standards_registry table maintains metadata about each implemented standard including standard tag, name, MCP server name, associated database tables, ingestion status, and last updated timestamps.

### Access Control and Security
User permissions can be managed at the table level, enabling fine-grained access to specific standards or ground truth datasets. Row-level security policies can be applied per standard:

Row-level security can be implemented for ground truth tables, enabling access control based on public availability or organization ownership. This ensures data isolation while maintaining appropriate access controls.

## Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy for Two-Layer Matching
Indexing strategy supports two-layer matching with Layer 1 semantic anchor indexing on section references, Layer 2 vector similarity indexing using ivfflat for embedding vectors, and combined indexes for optimized performance across both layers.

### Query Patterns for AI Agent Tools
Typical AI agent queries combine Layer 1 semantic anchor filtering with Layer 2 vector similarity search, selecting documents with section reference matching and ordering by embedding similarity scores.

---

## Future Standards Integration

### Template Approach for New Standards
When implementing new regulatory standards, the database structure follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Create standard-specific tables** following naming convention
2. **Update standards_registry** with new standard metadata
3. **Implement standard-specific ground truth** tables if available
4. **Configure access controls** appropriate to regulatory requirements

### Cross-Standard Analysis Capabilities
While AI agents operate within standard-specific boundaries, the unified database enables cross-standard analysis for advanced use cases:

Cross-standard analysis capabilities enable regulatory overlap analysis by comparing embeddings between different standards, identifying high similarity regulatory concepts across frameworks like FCA and MiFID.

## Operational Analytics and Management Information

### Strategic Data Collection Architecture

The Universal Standards Engine database architecture includes comprehensive interaction logging to generate operational intelligence and strategic insights for multiple stakeholder groups. This approach transforms routine compliance queries into valuable regulatory intelligence while maintaining enterprise-grade privacy and security.

### Interaction Analytics Schema

The interaction logging system captures granular usage data through standard-specific analytics tables:

Usage analytics tables capture comprehensive interaction data per standard including user and organizational context, tool usage patterns, billing alignment fields, regulatory navigation patterns, response characteristics, and temporal context. Cross-standard analytics views provide strategic insights by aggregating usage patterns, confidence metrics, processing times, and boundary message frequencies across regulatory standards.
