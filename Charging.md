# Charging Models and Billing Architecture Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document defines charging models and billing architecture for the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project ("UFSCMCP"). The intention is to start with charge levels initially set to zero, and evolve pricing based on demonstrated value and usage patterns.

Configuration-driven billing infrastructure is put in place from inception, to save the future need for unwieldy retrofitting.

## Value Proposition

The value of UFSCMCP lies in its power to make it easier for Financial Institutions to bring the right financial products to consumers safely and cost-effectively.

UFSCMCP transforms compliance from a burden into intelligence, enabling financial institutions to move faster, reduce costs, and maintain confidence in the ability to comply with Standards. Instead of adding complexity to an overwhelming regulatory landscape, our MCP Server cuts through red tape by making compliance intelligence accessible to any AI agent.

## Cost Context Analysis

- Compliance Staff Costs. Skilled and qualified compliance staff are very costly so it is important to enable them to do their job efficiently and accurately
  
- Efficiency. LLMs, AI Agents, and Tools are ideally suited to dealing with the heavy-lifting textual analysis involved in day-to-day compliance operations, and create major gains in efficiency.
  
- Risk Mitigation. Compliance can be viewed as risk management. A single missed compliance issue can cost £10M+ in regulatory fines and liability costs. Availability of the right AI is a significant protection. 

## Enterprise Expectations

- Professional billing infrastructure and invoicing

- Usage transparency and predictable cost structures

- Multiple pricing tiers for different organizational sizes

- Integration with existing procurement and finance systems
