# Vision, Mission, Identity

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's mission is to enable Financial Institutions to slice through red tape and make it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers. The red tape is spawned by the worldwide compulsive urge to make rules, combined with the real-life knotweed nature of the rules. Compliance with the rules is simply impossible without an AI-native application. 

We will be comprised of a suite of specialist MCP servers for Financial Institutions that is universal in the sense of being capable of ingesting any codified Standard and making the appropriate Tools accessible to any AI agent. Users, typically compliance officers and other professionals working in Financial Institutions, will thus be able to focus on senior executive tasks rather than get entangled in small-print. Our first Implemented Standard is the FCA Handbook.
