# Vision, Mission, Identity

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's mission is to enable Financial Institutions to make it easier to bring the right financial products to consumers safely and cost-effectively. 

Compliance with Standards is an unavoidable and necessary part of being a Financial Institution. These Standards have grown to be compendious. This is a natural habitat for AI, in which LLMs take seconds to ingest half-million-word documents.  

Standards are words-based, and therefore native to LLMs (whose middle initial is "Language"). AI-native Standards Compliance Tools thus have an inherent advantage.

With only pre-AI tools, or where AI is added later rather than being core to the architecture, compliance operations can be cumbersome and expensive, leading to higher costs and a drag on innovation, leading ultimately to poorer outcomes for consumers. 

Our AI-agentic Tools are AI-native. Using them will bring about a radical reduction in friction and cost for Financial Institutions, leading ultimately to improved outcomes for consumers.

The Tools are not intended to be autonomous, and human judgement will still be required. But the Tools will do much of the heavy lifting. Users, typically compliance officers and other professionals working in Financial Institutions, will be able to focus on senior executive tasks. 

The Tools will be held in a suite of specialist MCP servers. (MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is an open framework published by Anthropic, and is widely used in the construction of AI Agents). Each MCP server will cover an Implemented Standard. The ambition is universal in the sense of being capable of being applied to any codified Standard. Our first Implemented Standard is the FCA Handbook.

Accuracy and reliability have been engineered into Tool specification and operation. Financial Institutions' security and risk management requirements are embedded at the core. Scaling and performance have been designed in.

The MCP servers are available in an open-source repository on GitHub and a permissive MIT license. They are designed for enterprise self-hosting.
