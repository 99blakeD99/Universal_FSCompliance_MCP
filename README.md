# Vision, Mission, Identity

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's mission is to enable Financial Institutions to make it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers. This necessarily involves Compliance with Standards, which have grown to be compendious. 

With pre-AI tools, Compliance operations can be cumbersome and expensive, leading to higher costs and a drag on innovation, leading ultimately to poorer outcomes for consumers. 

Standards are words-based, and therefore native to LLMs (whose middle initial is "Language"). AI-native Standards Compliance Tools thus have an inherent advantage.

Our AI-agentic Tools are AI-native. They are available in an open-source repository on GitHub and a permissive MIT license, will bring about a radical reduction in friction and cost for Financial Institutions, leading ultimately to improved outcomes for consumers. 

We will be comprised of a suite of specialist MCP servers that contain the Tools. Each MCP server will cover an Implemented Standard. The ambition is universal in the sense of being capable of being applied to any codified Standard.

The MCP servers are designed for enterprise self-hosting.

Users, typically compliance officers and other professionals working in Financial Institutions, will thus be able to focus on senior executive tasks rather than get entangled in small-print. 

Our first Implemented Standard is the FCA Handbook.
