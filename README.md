**⚠️ EARLY STAGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT ⚠️**

# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project

**The open-source universal compliance intelligence platform built exclusively for financial services.** We rapidly ingest ANY well-articulated Standard to make compliance intelligence accessible to any AI agent through innovative MCP integration - slicing through red tape to enable compliance professionals to carry out senior executive tasks rather than get bogged down in small-print. **Our MCP tools turbocharge AI effectiveness by transforming general AI agents into compliance experts**, ultimately serving the goal of **making it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers**.

## 📊 Market Opportunity
**RegTech projected to grow from $11.7B to $83.8B by 2033 (21.6% CAGR)** *- Allied Market Research, 2025* - The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is positioned as the first MCP-integrated universal compliance platform for financial services.

## 🚧 Development Status

This repository represents an **active development project** building the Universal FSCompliance MCP platform.

## Universal Standards Engine

In principle the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is designed to rapidly ingest many well-articulated Standards. We are using the word "Standard" widely, to include:
- **Regulatory frameworks** (FCA Handbook, SEC rules, MiFID II, Basel III)
- **Industry codes** (conduct codes, best practice guidelines)  
- **Statutory requirements** (legislation, acts, laws)
- **International standards** (IFRS, SOX, ISO standards)
- **Jurisdictional regulations** (state, provincial, national requirements)
- **Consultation documents** (regulatory proposals, policy consultations, draft guidance)

Using the architectures developed for our first ingested Standard, the FCA Handbook, which serves as a proof of concept, we plan to expand to other Standards. Our goal is to develop an AI-enabled universal compliance intelligence that addresses many limitations of traditional RegTech approaches.

## Core Capabilities

**Primary Use Cases (Phase 2 Complete):**
- **Compliance Gap Analysis**: AI agents analyze policies to identify salient requirements and flag compliance gaps
- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Extract relevant requirements from FCA Handbook for specific analysis
- **Compliance Assessment**: Comprehensive policy analysis with confidence scoring

**Advanced Use Cases (Phase 3 Implementation):**
- **Regulatory Change Monitoring**: Track FCA Handbook updates and assess impact
- **Consultation Document Analysis**: Transform regulatory uncertainty from reactive scrambling to proactive strategic planning
- **Risk-Based Compliance**: Score compliance risk with prioritization recommendations
- **Audit Trail Management**: Collect and organize compliance evidence for examinations
- **Regulatory Relationship Mapping**: Visualize connections between regulations and business activities
- **Customer Scenario Validation**: Real-time compliance checking (e.g., "For customers aged 60+ holding Bitcoin, did risk warnings meet FCA requirements?")

**📈 Project Status**: Phase 2 Foundation Complete - Core architecture and framework established. Active development of Phase 3 compliance tools underway. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet selected as default LLM** based on extensive real-world validation through comprehensive development.

## Target Users

- **Compliance Officers**: Policy analysis and gap identification
- **Risk Managers**: Customer scenario validation and risk assessment
- **Regulatory Inspectors**: Automated compliance checking and reporting
- **Professional Advisers**: Regulatory guidance and requirement clarification

> **Important Note**: The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is a technology platform that provides AI-powered compliance analysis tools. It does not provide legal or regulatory advice. Our expertise lies specifically in the intersection of AI technology and compliance processes, making regulatory intelligence accessible to AI systems. Users remain responsible for compliance decisions and should consult qualified legal and regulatory professionals for definitive guidance.
