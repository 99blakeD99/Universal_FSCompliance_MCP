# Early Stage Development Project

This project is still in its early stages, but it has taken a sufficiently well-delineated form for it to be appropriate for it to be set out in this GitHub repository. Many of the capabilities described are still under development. However the pace of development to date, assisted by AI, is such as to support a firm belief that the capabilities will quickly be implemented.

# Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project

## Vision and Mission.

The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project's mission to slice through red tape and make it easier to bring the right financial products safely to consumers. The red tape is spawned by the worldwide compulsive urge to make rules, combined with the real-life knotweed nature of the rules. Compliance with the rules is simply impossible without an AI-native application like The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project. 

## Identity.

We set out to be **The open-source universal compliance intelligence platform built exclusively for financial services.** Structured as a suite of specialist MCP servers, we will rapidly ingest any Identified Standard to make the appropriate Tools accessible to any AI agent. This will free up significant time for users, typically compliance officers and other professionals working in financial institutions, to carry out senior executive tasks rather than get entangled in small-print. 

## Market Opportunity

The "RegTech" market in financial services is projected to grow from $11.7B to $83.8B by 2033 (21.6% CAGR) *- Allied Market Research, 2025*. The Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project is positioning to be an essential support for this market.
