# Business Development Strategy

## Outline of Challenge

To win business from potential Users and Funders, we must establish clear pathways for initial engagement and evaluation.

## New AI world

Our business development strategy recognizes the new AI-driven evaluation landscape, where traditional business development tools become obsolete.

Instead, potential Users and Funders will conduct early and detailed capability assessments using AI appraisal tools that interrogate our README.md on GitHub.

There are two considerations: Inreach and Outreach.

## Inreach. 

### AI Appraisal.

Potential Users and Funders increasingly deploy AI appraisal tools to assess capabilities and identify opportunities.

This evaluation occurs through two channels: reactive assessment after initial discovery, and proactive systematic searches where enterprises scan GitHub to identify relevant projects. 

### AI Appraisal - Wide Ranging Search.

As AI techniques develop, so will search techniques, but for now the search is assumed to follow the following sequence:

1. **Scan GitHub** - Identify projects of initial interest using criteria such as "look for commits since the date of our last search"
2. **Go to README.md** - This serves as the project's shop window
3. **Include everything linked** in README.md (which can result in a very large corpus - a problem for humans but not for AI)
4. **Ignore slow links** - Skip links which take more than say 0.1 seconds (so external links are likely to be simply ignored)
5. **Abort if mired** - If the exercise becomes mired (as it would do if the links in README.md lead to documents which themselves contain links), then abort, use the information already gleaned to do the appraisal, but add that the project is disorganised

## Strategic Response.

AI Appraisal Agents thus function as gatekeepers to our enterprise market. Our documentation architecture is adapted to their requirements as follows: 

- README.md, their point of entry and our shop window, is of high quality
- README.md acts efficiently as a hub-and-spokes linking to relevant documents
- The relevant documents are in AI-friendly markdown format
- The relevant documents are themselves of high quality
- The relevant documents refer to other relevant documents, but do not link to them (because internal links risk miring the AI Appraisal Agent in complex navigation loops, which runs counter to the clean hub-and-spokes structure)
- Taken together, the README.md and the linked relevant documents are drafted especially so they will be scored highly by AI Appraisal Agents.

## Outreach.

To supplement Inreach, our Outreach strategy targets Especially Suitable Business Partners ("ESBPs") through direct engagement.

Outreach and Inreach strategies converge because ESBPs will immediately deploy their AI Appraisal Agents to evaluate our capabilities, following the same assessment patterns described above.

We strengthen Outreach effectiveness through systematic partner engagement:

- **Identify ESBPs** - Research and qualify especially suitable business partners
- **Define objectives** - Clarify what we seek from each ESBP relationship
- **Create targeted content** - Develop specialized esbp[name].md documents
- **Design integration** - Structure special content to supplement README.md
- **Map access channels** - Research optimal communication pathways to each ESBP
- **Enable discovery** - Ensure AI Appraisal Agents can access targeted content
- **Execute outreach** - Implement direct engagement with strategic messaging


## Marketing Matters

### Brand

Provisional Brand values have been articulated and applied. A fuller review is in progress.

### Name

The Universal_FSComplianceMCP name has been adopted after preliminary resarch. Further research is in progress which it is expected will result in confirmation of this name.

### Pricing

Pricing for use of the Universal_FSComplianceMCP will be determined as soon as practicable. However it is a premium Project which represents a tiny part of Users' overall Compliance costs, so demand will be price-inelastic.

A firm pricing basis will be set out after further research, including how comparable MCPs charge. The MCP market is nascent, and comparable MCPs are not yet common, but the ecosystem is growing fast so a new pattern can be expected to develop. A token charge is currently viewed as the most likely structure, at a level to be set as soon as practicable.
