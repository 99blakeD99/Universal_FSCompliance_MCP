# LLM Selection Strategy for the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP

## Executive Summary

The following factors have emerged as important during the course of this Project:

- The LLM powering our MCP needs only to deal with text or text equivalents such as voice recordings. Thus multi-modal capability, a main focus of frontier LLMs, is unneeded. 

- Our MCP is designed to support human professionals, who make final decisions, so instantaneity would arguably be an over-engineered objective. A few seconds delay is acceptable. 
  
- New LLMs are emerging with such frequency as to make it unwise to commit to any one LLM.

- Enterprises have their own preferences, based on experience and relationships, and our stance is that we will fit in with their priorities.

- MCP servers run their own LLMs completely independently from whatever LLM the enterprise chooses for their AI agents. This is a fundamental architectural separation. Our MCP enables Users to experiment with whichever LLM suits their needs for specialist Compliance purposes.
   
- We have therefore engineered in an LLM-open approach, thus preserving enterprise flexibility both when the tools are initially adopted and as experience develops. 

## Wider Context

#### Compliance Executives' Time Scarcity

Given compliance executives' time scarcity it may not be an efficient use of resources to use an inferior LLM and then possibly run into quality issues, or expend much time experimenting with alternative LLMs that have not proven themselves in such a well-suited compliance context. 

#### Compliance Accuracy Is Critical

In financial services, compliance errors can result in:

- Regulatory fines
- Reputation damage and customer loss
- Legal liability and professional indemnity claims
- Operational disruption and remediation costs

The cost differential between LLMs is insignificant compared to these compliance failure risks.

#### Strategic Positioning

Our MCP's LLM costs represent a small fraction of total compliance spend while providing significant competitive differentiation through proven quality and expert-level reasoning capabilities that align with our AI-compliance interface expertise-backed positioning.

#### Separate Architectures

A major advantage of the MCP protocol is that general enterprise LLM use is separated from the use of LLMs inside the MCP, which can therefore use the optimum LLM for its special purpose. For example:

**Enterprise AI Agents** can use:

- GPT-4, GPT-4o, or other OpenAI LLMs
- Gemini Pro or other Google LLMs  
- LLaMA 3, Mistral, or other open-source LLMs
- Any proprietary or fine-tuned enterprise LLMs

**FSCompliance MCP Server** can independently run:

- Configurable default LLM provider 
- Alternative LLMs if Enterprise chooses
- Completely separate infrastructure and API calls

#### Different LLMs for Different Tools within the MCP

This is a theoretical possibility which may become important in the future.

For the time being, in order to avoid complexity, we have adopted the simplifying assumption that one LLM will be used throughout each standard-specific MCP server in the Universal_FSCompliance_MCP Project.

This architectural decision can be revisited in future releases if the need arises.

#### Data Security

Financial Institutions and Financial Services Companies are particularly worried about data security and privacy, and some gravitate towards local LLM deployment. However, powerful non-local LLMs with data protection capabilities are emerging.


## In-Use Criteria

Based on our experience it is suggested that Users choose an LLM taking into account the following criteria:

**1. Compliance Reasoning Quality**
- Complex regulatory interpretation capabilities
- Multi-document analysis and synthesis
- Contextual understanding of financial services regulations
- Nuanced risk assessment and gap detection
- Professional-grade output suitable for regulatory scrutiny

**2. Enterprise Requirements**
- Accuracy and reliability for critical compliance decisions
- Consistency in responses across similar queries
- Appropriate confidence levels and uncertainty handling
- Integration with existing enterprise workflows

**3. Business Considerations**
- Cost implications 
- Competitive differentiation in RegTech
- Competitive differentiation in Financial Services
- Brand alignment with "expert-backed" positioning
- Customer liability and risk management

**4. Technical Architecture**
- Scalability and performance characteristics
- Multi-LLM support and flexibility
- Integration simplicity and maintenance

## Future Action

AI is changing fast and we will work to keep our decisions current. This work will include:

- Specific competitive analysis in the RegTech space.

- LLM performance validation in operation.

- Assessments of groundbreaking LLMs as they appear.
